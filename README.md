This repository contains an iOS sample application demonstrating how to use [SCNetworkReachabilityKit][SCNetworkReachabilityKit].

Using asynchronous notifications only, the application presents the status of three reachable networks:

1. by name, specifically [Apple](www.apple.com),
2. the Internet and
3. the local-link wi-fi network.

## Screenshots
